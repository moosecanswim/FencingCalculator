Fencing Text File

Algorythm:
determine the dimensions of the yard.  Length and Width
determine the material for the fence (metal or wood)
determine how many total gates they are looking for
	confirm that the customer wants the one mandatory one and (total - 1) optional gates
	ensure they have at most 3 gates
	
calculate perimeter
	(2* length) + (2 * width)
calculate cost of perimeter fencing
	for wood: 25* perimeter
	for chain link: 16*perimeter
calculate gate cost
	150*total number of gates
	
calculate cost of materials
	gateCost + fencingCost
calculate taxAmount of materials
	0.06*materialCost
	
calculate total cost
	taxAmount + materialCost + buildingPermit
	
	
Pseudo Code:
ask user for length of yard
get length
ask user for width of yard
get width of yard
calculate perimeter = 2*length + 2*width;

ask user what material they want
get what material the user wants

ask user how many gates they want
get how many gates

calculate cost of fencing:
	materialCost = (fencePrice*perimeter + gatePrice*gate)	
	materialTax = (materialCost * 0.06)
	materialAndTax = materialCost+materialTax
	buildingPermit = 50;
	
	totalCost = materialAndTax+buildingPermit
